# NLP-Based-Chatbot

This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot using a neural network for intent classification. The chatbot is trained to understand user queries and respond appropriately based on predefined intents and patterns.

How It Works

User Input: Accepts user text queries.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenizes and vectorizes the input text.
Intent Prediction: A trained neural network predicts the user's intent.
Response Selection: Matches the predicted intent with responses in intents.json.
Response Output: Provides a suitable reply to the user.

NLP Pipeline for Chatbot:

  Input Handling: Accepts user input as text.
  
  Preprocessing:
    Cleans the text (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation).
    Tokenizes the input (splits text into words).
    Converts tokens into numerical sequences using a Tokenizer.
    
  Intent Prediction:
    Feeds the numerical sequence to a trained neural network model.
    The model predicts the userâ€™s intent (e.g., "greeting" or "goodbye").
  
  Response Selection:
    Matches the predicted intent with predefined responses in the intents.json file.
    Randomly selects a response from the corresponding intent group.
  
  Output: Returns the chosen response to the user.
